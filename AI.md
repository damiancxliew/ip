# AI Assistance Log

This project increment was enhanced with the help of AI tools.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5): Helped refactor long methods (e.g., `MainApp.handle`), and add Javadoc comments.

## Examples
- Refactoring: Split `handle` into smaller private methods (`handleBye`, `handleList`, etc.) with ChatGPT guidance.
- Documentation: Javadoc for `MainWindow` and `TaskList` written with AI assistance.
